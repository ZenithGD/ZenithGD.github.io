# My personal portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, made with Next.js. You can find info about me, about the projects I'm doing at the moment, and my current career. I will be uploading some entries to a blog, mainly for showing my learning progress, or just writing about random subjects, who knows!

You can also find links to my social networks right there, if you want to contact me. Thanks for passing by!

## Notes

For now, the portfolio is only available in Spanish, as it is my main language, but I'm planning to make it available in more languages.
